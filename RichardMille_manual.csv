Capping off an unforgettable season. @7ohannesb0 wins a record 19th victory of the campaign and a fourth Crystal Globe in Oslo. There’s no stopping him. #RichardMille
A night to remember. @myeoh_official wins Best Actress @TheAcademy awards 2023 for her leading performance in @allatoncemovie. #RichardMille
Simply the best. @thiam_nafi faced off stiff competition to set a new pentathlon World Record at the European indoor athletics championships in Istanbul. #RichardMille
"The RM 07-04 required three years of development because of many challenges: developing a new, very compact and skeletonised in-house automatic movement, guaranteeing high shock resistance, integrating the exterior perfectly into the movement while leaving its workings visible."
Offering a women’s skeleton sports watch is a gamble that few have dared to take. The RM 07-04 Automatic Sport collection is as much about aesthetics as it is about technicity. http://bit.ly/3KrARMD #RichardMille
Richard Mille has always endeavoured to adapt each of its models to the needs and feelings of its partners. It is in this spirit that the RM 07-04 Automatic Sport was imagined and dedicated to the brand's sports partners. http://bit.ly/3KrARMD #RichardMille

"The RM 07-04 Automatic Sport is the most ‘airy’ of the Richard Mille's ladies’ models, an achievement made possible by the use of materials such as Quartz TPT® and Carbon TPT® for the case. http://bit.ly/3KrARMD #RichardMille"
"“The watch is really nice and super light. It is so light that it makes me want to move. I'm a high jumper, so feeling light for me is very significant. ""http://bit.ly/3KrARMD"
The RM 07-04 Automatic Sport collection provides another opportunity for @NellyKorda to express herself freely in her discipline. The RM 07-04 has already demonstrated its ability to withstand the shocks and g-force inherent to golf. http://bit.ly/3KrARMD #RichardMille
"The new RM 07-04 Automatic Sport confirmed its resistance to 5,000 g’s of acceleration, a major feat for our most compact calibre comprising 328 components on a surface of only 29.90 x 22.00 x 5.13 mm. http://bit.ly/3KrARMD #RichardMille"
"“The watch is very slim, much lighter, and it feels very snug and just easy on the wrist I love that the colors pop, the blend with the burgundy and the pink and the fact that the face of the watch is white. It’s literally art. It’s a very beautiful sport piece.”"
".@thiam_nafi two-time Olympic in the heptathlon, undertakes superhuman preparation to meet the challenge of this discipline. The wide range of skills means she has to be adaptable to any situation, a quality that inspired the design of the new RM 07-04 Automatic Sport."
